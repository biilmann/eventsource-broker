EvenSource Broker
=================

A simple bridge between EventSource and an AMQP fanout exchange.

EventSource is a new browser standard released as part of the HTML5
spec.

It lets the browser send a never-ending HTTP request to a server and
provides a javascript API for binding to events pushed from the server.

EventSource is very handy when you don't need the full bidirectional
communication that Websockets offers. it plays well with load-balancers,
intermediary proxies and HTTPS termination.

This library sets up an EventSource that clients can connect to
specifying a channel to listen to in the query string. The server
connects to a fanout AMQP exchange and routes AMQP messages as events to
the javascript clients.

MongoDB is used to store user and connection information.

The server expects the AMQP messages to be JSON following the format:

    {
        "channel": "some-channel", // Required
        "data": "{/"msg/": /"data/"}", // Required
        "id": "event-id", // optional
        "name": "event-name" // optional
    }

To open connections to a channel a user with an key and a secret is
expected to exist in the database. Before opening a connection a socket
id must be aquired from by calling POST /socket

A simple example of how to interact with this API can be found in the
[https://github.com/eshq/eshq-gem](eshq ruby gem).

Installation
============

Clone the repository, cd to the root of it and execute

    cabal install

Run as:

    eventsource-broker -p <port>

The broker will look for an AMQP_URL environment variable for a broker
to connect to. It also takes a MONGO_URL for configuring the database
connection and an ORIGIN variable that should be a url the server runs
on for cross domain requests.
